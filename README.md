# 📚 Library Management System with Embedded MySQL Integration

## 🔍 Project Overview

This is a **desktop-based Library Management System** developed using **Java Swing** for the user interface and **MySQL** for backend storage. The system aims to automate and simplify daily library operations such as managing books, members, issuing and returning books, and handling fines.

It supports multiple user roles—**Admin**, **Librarian**, and **User**—each with dedicated dashboards and access to role-specific features.
